## Scalable FastAPI Applications on AWS

Build scalable applications with FastAPI and Terraform that run on AWS!

Tests - Maria Camila Hernández Ortiz 

## Topics:

- structure a Git repository
- perform code reviews
- document your API
- manage multiple configurations and environments
- deploy and monitor your application
- reproduce your infrastructure environment
- configure and manage a CI/CD pipeline
- continuously deploy
- manage a database and database migrations
- build, publish, and use private Python packages
- write and run end-to-end tests
- develop an application with small, test-driven iterations
- use feature flags

## Tools:

- GitLab: open-source solution for managing the full software development lifecycle
- Poetry: tool used for Python packaging and dependency management
- FastAPI: high-performance, easy-to-learn, fast-to-code, ready-for-production web framework for building APIs
- pytest:  makes it easy to write Python tests
- AWS Cloudwatch: monitoring and observability service
- AWS ECR: Amazon Elastic Container Registry
- Terraform: open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool
- Codecov: service that helps you track the coverage of your code
- Sentry: service that helps you track unhandled errors inside your applications


## Initial Setup

1. New Project
2. Repository structure: 
  - lib
  - infraestructure
  - services
  - ci_cd
  - tools
3. Create a service
4. Add tests
5. FastAPI app: 
  - client: pytest fixture, function executed by the pytest runner
  - 1. GIVEN tells you about the initial conditions/context.
    2. WHEN tells you what's occurring that needs to be tested.
    3. THEN tells you what's the expected outcome.
6. Test and code quality
  - Docker image
